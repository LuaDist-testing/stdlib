	* .gitmodules: Remove. Slingshot regenerates on demand.
	* .gitignore: Ignore .gitmodules.
	* slingshot: Update.
	* bootstrap.slingshot: Copied from slingshot, for clean checkout
	bootstrapping before slingshot subproject is populated.
	* bootstrap.conf: Adjust.

	maint: collect previous release notes into NEWS.
	* NEWS: new file, required for the Slingshot release process.
	* local.mk (old_NEWS_hash): Update.

2013-05-05  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	slingshot: add slingshot as a git submodule.
	* .gitmodules: New file.
	* slingshot: New submodule.

2013-04-30  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	configury: there is no distinct top_srcdir with non-recursive make.
	* std/std.mk (dist_doc_DATA, dist_files_DATA, dist_modules_DATA):
	Use plain $(srcdir).

	std: don't overwrite lua library tables.
	Overwriting a global library table causes hard-to-debug problems
	when the C part of Lua is holding references to the original
	(overwritten) table.
	* std/std.lua.in: When injecting new entry points into a core
	library, do it an entry at a time to avoid breaking references to
	the original address in the core.  This fixes a problem with the
	`package.path` and `package.cpath` being lost when set from
	LUA_INIT, among many other potential issues.

2013-04-14  Reuben Thomas  <rrt@sc3d.org>

	Remove non-core modules, which go into separate lua-rrtlib for ad-hoc modules

2013-04-11  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	specs: upgrade to Specl 5.
	* specs/string_ext_spec.yaml, specs/table_ext_spec.yaml: Update
	all 'should_error' matchers to saner Specl 5 ordering.
	* specs/specs.mk (SPECL_MIN): Bump to 5.

	getopt: also requires io_ext module to be loaded.
	* std/getopt.lua: Load io_ext into a local table.

2013-04-10  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	configury: install correctly with configure or luarocks.
	For the classic './configure; make; make install' to work we need
	to install to '$luadir' as discovered by ax_lua.m4.  But we also
	need to install directly to luarocks '$(LUADIR)' otherwise the
	stdlib source files are not copied onto the LUA_PATH properly by
	'luarocks make stdlib-*-1.rockspec'.
	* mkrockspecs.lua: Move from here...
	* build-aux/mkrockspecs: ...to here.
	* GNUmakefile (rockspecs): Adjust accordingly.
	* build-aux/mkrockspecs: Synchronise with the version that loads
	a template, interpolates the variables and writes out the result.
	* rockspecs.lua (build.install_command): Pass luadir to ensure
	installation to the correct directory for luarocks.
	* stdlib.rockspec.in: Remove.
	* bootstrap: New script to call autoreconf for compatibility with
	new build-aux/mkrockspecs.
	* GNUmakefile (Makefile.in): Use it.

2013-04-08  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	docs: point to github pages documentation.
	* README.md (Documentation): Point to github pages documentation.

	docs: fix stupid typo.
	* README.md (Installation): That would be luarOCKS not luarCOKS :-$

	maint: correct git master installation instructions.
	* README.md (Installation): Provide working instructions for
	installing git master with Luarocks.
	Liberal use of additional useful links.

2013-04-08  Reuben Thomas  <rrt@sc3d.org>

	README.md: simplify installation instructions, and other minor tweaks

2013-04-07  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	maint: remove spurious LUA override in Travis CI build.
	* .travis.yml (script): No need to force Lua 5.1 when running
	initial make now that we fixed up luadocs.

	docs: we need to autoreconf a master branch github checkout.
	* README.md (Installation): Show missing autoreconf invocation.

2013-04-07  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	Revert "maint: support rerunning check-local in multiple lua environments."
	This reverts commit e052c045cfc5b837e2dcb36db2e1cd34791a3c69.

	Conflicts:
		Makefile.am

2013-04-07  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	docs: rename README to README.md for github display goodness.
	* README: Move from here...
	* README.md: ...to here.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add README.md.

	maint: tweak luadoc wrapper to work with Travis CI.
	* .travis.yml (script): luadoc is a shell wrapper that calls the
	wrong lua, so make a copy, patch it to call a compatible lua binary,
	and run that instead.

	maint: run luadoc in a Lua 5.1 environment for Travis CI.
	* .travis.yml (script): luadoc only works with Lua 5.1, so set the
	execution environment up carefully for it to run correctly.

	maint: make luadoc available to Travis CI.
	* .travis.yml (install): Install a system luarocks, and a luadoc
	binary that uses it.

	maint: don't forget to make std/std.lua for Travis CI.
	* .travis.yml (script): Run a full make to ensure std.lua is
	generated in time for running mkrockspecs.lua!

	configury: don't hardcode specl, use $(SPECL) everywhere.
	* specs/specs.mk (specs-check-local): Use $(SPECL), because bare
	specl may not be on PATH, or otherwise correctly enabled.
	* .travis.yml (script): Always call make with V=1 for better
	logging.

	maint: install help2man for Travis CI specl build.
	* .travis.yml (script): specl-v4 build currently fails when trying
	to regenerate specl.1.in, so install help2man until that bug is
	fixed.

	maint: set LUA_PATH for specl build with Travis CI.
	* .travis.yml (script): Make sure local specl install can find
	ansicolors and lyaml in local luarocks tree.

	maint: remove unnecessary manual ansicolors installation for Travis CI.
	* .travis.yml: The previous error was caused by a bug in specl
	release 3, not a lack of ansicolors.  Remove the bogus ansicolors
	installation now that specl-v4 is released.

	maint: make sure ansicolors is installed for Travis CI.
	* .travis.yml (script): Install ansicolors to local luarocks tree.

	maint: make sure specl is installed for Travis CI.
	* .travis.yml (script): Install specl, and use it for make check.

	configury: respect `make V=0` in rockspecs rule.
	* GNUmakefile (rockspecs): Be quieter by default.

	std: strip leading "std." from global namespaces.
	* std/std.lua.in: Before injecting symbols into the global
	namespace, strip off the leading "std." added by std.modules.lua.

	configury: use uninstalled stdlib again. Again. (issue #24)
	* specs/specs.mk (std_path): Move from here...
	* Makefile.am (std_path): ...to here.
	(LUA_ENV): Make sure to set this so that mkrockspecs rule uses
	uninstalled stdlib again.
	* specs/specs.mk (SPECL_ENV): Simplify accordingly.

	configury: fix a typo in luarocks-config.lua generation.
	* GNUmakefile (luarocks-config.lua): Only one e in 'echo'.

	maint: integration with Travis CI system.
	* .travis.yml: configure, build and test with each of Lua 5.1,
	Lua 5.2 and luajit.
	* GNUmakefile (luarocks-config.lua): Set interpreter environment
	variables for luarocks invocations.
	* mkrockspecs.lua: Invoke luarocks via user LUAROCKS setting.
	* stdlib.rockspec.in (build.build_command): Pass LUA as a
	configure precious variable so that recent ax-lua.m4 uses it as
	passed instead of running the hardcoded search for a lua binary.
	* README: Add travis build status badge markup.  Plus some
	indentation corrections for correct markdown code rendering.

2013-04-02  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* std/std.lua.in: Strip "std." prefix before injecting required
	symbols into global namespace.

2013-03-29  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	maint: support rerunning check-local in multiple lua environments.
	* .luamultienv: Example multienv runner.
	* Makefile.am (SPECL): Allow overriding.
	(MULTICHECK): Location of multicheck script.
	(check-local): Run multicheck without looping, if present.

	getopt: ensure we find _G.arg from Specl nested setfenv environments.  (issue #27)
	Although only necessary for Lua 5.1, this fix is harmless for Lua
	5.2, and we support both!
	* src/getopt.lua (processArgs): Use only fully qualified _G.arg
	references, for Lua 5.1 Specl compatibility.
	Fixes issue #27.

2013-03-29  Reuben Thomas  <rrt@sc3d.org>

	getopt: instead of parsing undefined options, stop at first non-option
	This is a configurable behaviour in C getopt, and does what I actually
	wanted in the first place. If the other behaviour has a use case, it
	can be reinstated later.

2013-03-26  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	string_ext: propagate string metamethods correctly. (issue #26)
	* specs/string_ext_spec.yaml (describe caps, describe chomp)
	(describe escape_pattern, describe escape_shell, describe finds)

	that it carries all string functions too.
	Fixes issue #26.

	refactor: eliminate forward declarations by reordering string_ext.lua.
	* src/string_ext.lua (split): Move above require_version, the
	earliest caller. Declare as a local.  Rewove forward declaration.

	(format): Move above assert, the earliest caller. Declare as
	local. Remove forward declaration.

	* specs/string_ext_spec.yaml (context by name): Add back
	accidentally deleted line.

	refactor: simplify specs/string_ext_spec.yaml.

	globals.
	* src/debug_init.lua: Wrap _DEBUG in a returned table, but
	initialize from _G._DEBUG when first loaded.

	package_ext: don't perturb the global environment by default.
	For backwards compatibility, `require "std"` will still write

	much more hygienic and return everything in a table, like most
	other modules:
	* src/package_ext.lua (M): Define module symbols in this table

	* src/std.lua.in: Inject package_ext module symbols into global
	namespace.
	* specs/package_ext_spec.yaml: Specify new behaviour, being
	careful about `require "std"` side-effects.

	string_ext: fix a bad assumption in a spec example.
	Running string.format in the expectation `should` uses the core
	Lua string.format which doesn't prettify tables, but we're
	comparing it to the string_ext `..` operator which uses the std
	enhanced string.format, and that *does* prettify tables.
	* specs/string_ext_spec.yaml (stringifies non-string arguments):
	Manually expand the the stringified table in should to match the
	std prettified table stringification.

	list: fix standalone loading of string_ext module.
	This fix reenables simple 'require "string_ext"' without an additional
	'require "std"'.
	* src/string_ext.lua: Load the list module, which is used in split().
	Store APIs from `require "strbuf"`.

2013-03-14  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	list: fix standalone loading of list module.

	'require "std"'.
	* src/list.lua (new): Add a forward declaration.
	(sub, concat, rep, reverse, transpose, enpair, flatten, shape)
	(indexKey, indexValue): Use new, rather than list.new.
	* src/getopt.lua (processArgs): Call local 'getOpt' function. Global
	getopt.getOpt may never exist!

2013-03-10  Reuben Thomas  <rrt@sc3d.org>

	README: mention all extra dependencies of fstable

	getopt: remove the need for ugly getopt.Option constructor

2013-03-09  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	maint: support 'make check V=1' and 'SPECL_OPTS=-v make check'.

	Pull request/move to lua52 module style

2013-02-12  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	configury: make sure we build std.lua when necessary.

	tree: fix bugs when using a list of tables as keys
	
	Thanks for this. I don't currently have another use case than Zile to test with.

2011-12-16  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@vaughan.pe>

	tree: fix bugs when using a list of tables as keys
	To be fully general, tree should allow table keys so that it's
	possible to write:
	  $ lua -lstd
	  > t, k1, k2 = tree.new(), {key='a'}, {key='b'}
	  > t[{"k1", "k2"}] = "string keys"; t[{k1, k2}] = "table keys"
	  > = t[{"k1", "k2"}], t[{k1, k2}]
	  string keys    table keys
	This patch fixes 3 bugs that prevent that from working.
	* src/tree.lua (metatable.__newindex): Detect subtrees correctly
	by comparing against the tree metatable, rather than assuming any
	"table" type is a correct match.
	Use rawset to insert a new node without triggering the __index
	metamethod.
	(metatable.__index): Don't recurse into table key members, only
	the list entries to be folded, by checking whether the table has
	a length first - for t[{k1, k2}], {k1, k2} is a list (with length)
	and should be folded, but k1 (k1 = {key='a'}) is not a list and
	should not.

2007-02-21  rrt  <rrt>

	anyway.

	Remove "zip" and "unzip" aliases for list.transpose. Add a note to the
	documentation instead.

	In io.lua, remove some io. prefixes (that don't make the code less

	posix.basename.

	Add two functions to list module: flatten and shape, to flatten and
	reshape arbitrarily nested lists.

	Add a paragraph of documentation to the top of the rex module in
	preparation for lrexlib 1.20 (rex.lua will leave stdlib and move to
	lrexlib).

	commented-out) metamethods.

	Probable bug-fixing in string module obscured by removal of string.
	prefix from function definitions and calls.

	faulty ones.

	Add deepclone to table from Jamie Webb's code.

	Remove import, and instead use 5.1-style require (tested with compat-5.1.lua).
	Assume a LUA_DIR of "/", hence rename files accordingly.

2005-09-04  rrt  <rrt>

	Fix string.ltrim and string.rtrim to return only the advertised return value.
	Fix string.trim to do what it says on the tin; it was completely
	broken.

2004-09-08  rrt  <rrt>

	Fix assert when called with only one argument: arg has the value {n=0} when there are no variadic arguments, not nil as I assumed.

2004-02-17  rrt  <rrt>

	Comment the constructor.

	Check error return when loading file, so that if file is not found we don't abort immediately so that all LUA_PATH entries are checked.

2004-02-05  rrt  <rrt>

	Tidy up abstract syntax rules: there's now only one per production.
	Keep action functions for more complex rules. Looks as though we only
	ever have one or the other (because simple rules don't take into
	account any housekeeping info) so perhaps simplify this again.

	Make lists not have a ty field, but just be lists of whatever they
	contain.

	Return false instead of nil for empty parse trees, so as not to upset
	ipairs iterations over lists.

2004-02-05  rrt  <rrt>

	Tidy up the code, mostly by shortening the names of frequently-used variables.

	Allow import to report errors during importing.

2004-02-04  rrt  <rrt>

	Added Diego Nahab for his mbox parser.

	Added Diego Nahab's mbox parser.

2004-02-04  rrt  <rrt>

	Rework the API: now has a single method exposed, parse, and the other methods have been moved inside parse as local functions. The constructor no longer takes a token list.
	Also, provide support for producing an abstract parse tree rather than
	the (default) concrete one.

	Full details in the all-new documentation.

2004-02-04  rrt  <rrt>

	Clarify note about import and add TODO about markup tags.

2004-02-02  rrt  <rrt>

	Massacre the object implementation, reverting to implementing sets as simple tables, which seems to be better for general use. A lot of the code in this file is now non-functional; I'll be making it work later, integrating it with Jamie Webb's code. The module may get folded back into table.

	Make list.map and list.filter work on lists that have nil elements.

	Fix __call metamethod.

	writeLine -> io.writeLine

	Fix io.writeLine (somehow two lines had become swapped).

	writeLine -> io.writeLine

	Various modifications prompted by Jamie Webb's submission of his own standard library. So far I have assimilated improvements that map directly on to existing code, and also removed some functions that didn't seem to be that useful. Looking at the code again provoked other miscellaneous improvements.

2004-02-01  rrt  <rrt>

	In the previous commit, which had a bogus log message, I fixed io.readDir: split --> string.split.
	In this one, I improved the formatting of io.readDir slightly.

	Improve spacing of comments.

	If -version is given and no command-line args, then terminate after showing the version message.

	Explain that although import is used internally, users should use require (as in README) and why.

	Removed bit._INTEGER_BITS, because it's the same as math._INTEGER_BITS. I suspect I meant to do this ages ago.

	Added a few more people I thought of.

	Formalise the README: this project is no longer just mine.
	Add a list of AUTHORS: the first contributions have arrived.

	This script was trivial and wrong.

	Added math.floor and math.round, based on code from Johann Hibschman.

	Add math.floor and math.round, based on code from Johann Hibschman.

2004-01-31  rrt  <rrt>

	Fix pickle: format->string.format (thanks to Johann Hibschman).

2004-01-29  rrt  <rrt>

	Default the from and to parameters of list.slice to the start and end of the list respectively.

	Add primitive way to cope with missing non-standard C libraries, and a TODO to deal with missing C libraries properly.

	Fix table.newDefault to use correct name for __index metamethod.

	Improve module description in first line.

	Fix tostring to work on self-referential tables.

2004-01-27  rrt  <rrt>

	Corrected misnaming of functions and added documentation.

2004-01-26  rrt  <rrt>

	Add string.format extension to make it not try to format if there is only one argument.

2004-01-25  rrt  <rrt>

	Update to Lua 5. This is an old change which I forgot to check in; ldoc is *not* the way forward for stdlib documentation. This checkin is just for completeness.

2004-01-10  rrt  <rrt>

	*** empty log message ***

2004-01-10  rrt  <rrt>

	Change "returns" lines to "@returns" for better LuaDoc-ness.
	Add string.tonumbersi.

	Minor corrections and LuaDocification of some other comments.

2003-10-22  rrt  <rrt>

	More Lua 5 tweaks, and a couple of minor bugfixes.

2003-10-21  rrt  <rrt>

	Oops; added file with incorrect name; re-add with correct name.

	Add "import" from LTN 11 to overcome require's problem with circular dependencies.
	Remove string.next, as string.gfind provides an equivalent iterator.

2003-10-20  rrt  <rrt>

	More renaming for consistency, and move more code around. This introduced the first cyclic dependency between modules since I moved to Lua 5, and I've had to cure this with a C include-style trick, since Lua 5 require just overflows the stack when there's a recursive call of require.

	Add an iterator for the values in a set, and use it; methods are now organised into those that access the data structure and those that call other methods.

	Objectify the implementation, and add LuaDoc-style markup to the comments.

	Write methods outside object prototype (i.e. in more consistent form for stdlib).

2003-10-18  rrt  <rrt>

	Rename std.data.logic to std.bit, as it extends the C bit library.

	Make a namespace for list routines.

	Fix bug in curry properly.

	Finish renaming in io.io. Update TODO for getopt in std.lua.

	Re-add mistakenly removed logic (I confused the ability to take multiple args with the ability to take lists).

	assert lives again! math added to hold math function extensions.

	Remove logic (no longer needed; _INTEGER_BITS moved to math, band &c. already work on lists). Various other movements and renaming of modules.

	Routines moves to std.list and std.base.

	More renaming. Remove boolean routines for when bitlib is not present. There's no excuse in Lua 5!

	Use ipairs instead of table.getn loops.

	Use pairs () instead of deprecated for "i, v in t" form.

	Rename table routines. Simplify compose.

	Renamed some libraries for Lua 5-ification reasons.

	Fix a minor bug and remove some debugging code.

2003-10-18  rrt  <rrt>

	A new module (and family): algorithm, with first member algorithm.lcs, which implements the longest common subsequence algorithm needed for diff.
	std.object has been reworked, and now fits much better with Lua 5,
	although the interface to it is pretty much the same as before.

	Some other Lua 5-isation has been done, but not much; there's still a
	lot left to do in std.data in particular.

2003-10-13  rrt  <rrt>

	Fix call to writeLine (now io.writeLine).

2003-09-28  rrt  <rrt>

	More Lua 5-ification changes, mostly to the io modules this time.

2003-09-26  uid30086  <uid30086>

	Another round of changes for Lua 5-ification. This completes the changes to the string library (used to be the text library), and adds std.rex (complements my C rex library). Other changes are mostly to accomodate this; a few extras have snuck in.

2003-09-25  rrt  <rrt>

	First set of changes moving to Lua 5-like naming conventions for the libraries.

2003-09-15  rrt  <rrt>

	Use math.mod rather than bit.mod for wider compatibility.

	Wrap notes field of prog structure before output.

2003-09-12  rrt  <rrt>

	More changes to update to Lua 5.0. Nearly there now, I think, as I have several scripts working!

2003-09-11  rrt  <rrt>

	Another few search-and-replace function names to update to Lua 5. Mostly string functions this time.

2003-09-10  rrt  <rrt>

	More search-and-replace and wholesale code removal (notably POSIX getopt) for Lua 5.

	Another swathe of Lua 5 updates. Now my little script that I'm testing nearly works, which means that quite a lot of the code in the libraries is at least vaguely correct!

2003-09-09  rrt  <rrt>

	A slew of updates in the march to Lua-5-ify the libraries. I've just been working on a particular small script and changing things "on demand", and I've not even managed to make the script work yet, so there's almost certainly a lot of work still to go.

2003-06-04  rrt  <rrt>

	Convert to Lua 5.0, and some slight tidying.

	Do TODOs for Lua 5 (use "le" tagmethod -- will have to become a metamethod) and ability to force a function to return only one result.

	Update std.patch40 to std.patch50 for Lua 5. Now none of the other modules need it.

	Make readDir return an unsorted list of files. Unfortunately, -U isn't supported by ls on all platforms.

2003-03-14  rrt  <rrt>

	Update to match new directory structure (rather overdue!).

2003-01-06  rrt  <rrt>

	Use endOfLine in chomp and wrap.

2002-10-18  rrt  <rrt>

	Removed std.logic; now folded into std.data.logic

	std.logic now merged into std.data.logic.

	Merge the two logic modules.

2002-09-28  rrt  <rrt>

	Add tabulate function to use tabulator methods, and use it.

2002-09-10  rrt  <rrt>

	Sigh. New bnot didn't work. Next time I'll think and test rather better before straying from the path of righteousness.

	I was being very dim about bnot. Oops. Roberto pointed it out. I hang my head in shame.

	Revert to previous version to avoid losing precision (specifically, LSB).

	Shorter implementation of bxor, and bnot thanks to a remark by Paul Hsieh on lual (Message-Id: <0H26009OMQ9J59@mta5.snfc21.pbi.net>).
	Kept band (as the primitive to make bxor) and bor (because de
	Morganising it would involve a call to bnot and two to band, hence
	making it three times slower).

2002-09-09  rrt  <rrt>

	Poor man's logic functions (for those who can't use bitlib). Also calculate the number of bits in the word.

	Add std.logic

2002-09-06  rrt  <rrt>

	Improve layout of usage message when no command line options (don't have trailing blank line).

2002-09-05  rrt  <rrt>

	Add withFileOrHandle, which takes a filename, handle or uses a default handle, opens the file if appropriate, and passes the handle to a given function.
	Use it to generalise readLines and readFile.

	It's tempting to generalise writeLine too, but writeLine ("foo", "bar") is
	ambiguous: do we want to write "foo" and "bar" to _OUTPUT, or "bar" to
	file "foo"?

2002-09-05  rrt  <rrt>

	Make patches work with any version that starts with "Lua 4.0", to cope with 4.0.1 and any future point releases.
	Replace unpack with a recursive version (based on code from John
	Belmonte) that copes with any number of values.

	Change "key" to "index" everywhere for consistency.

	Improve comments for tinvert

	Change intersect tag method to division, and add TODO to implement proper subset tagmethod in Lua 5.0.

	Rename intersect to setintersect for consistency, and define setunion (= merge).

2002-08-28  rrt  <rrt>

	Allow stringifier methods again, but they are now only used by tostring. Allows more cosmetic stringification, while not stopping pickling from working.

2002-08-27  rrt  <rrt>

	Don't need stringify and pickler tables any more, and tostring and pickle can be simplified. They both use tabulator where necessary.

	Remove interaction between pickle and tostring, which is no longer needed, as they both now use tabulator methods where necessary.

	Add tabulator method table for turning arbitrary objects (typically tagged userdata) into tables. Use this to finally fix tostring and pickle. Oh, yes.

2002-08-23  rrt  <rrt>

	A last gamble. Then I'll have to sit down and work it out again.

	Another desperate attempt.

	Fix up. I hope. This is starting to drive me insane.

	Typo.

	Fix default case for pickling.

	Fix typo.

	More fixes.

	More fixes to pickling. I got in a pickle with this one.

	Make pickling work properly on numbers and nil by having a "self" parameter for stringifier and pickler functions. They're more like classes now.

	Fix buglet (can't concat to nil).

	Make pickle work for numbers and nil.

	Add tinvert, and update some comments to LDoc format.

2002-08-22  rrt  <rrt>

	Correct call of warn to expand arg list.

2002-08-15  rrt  <rrt>

	Add utility for making zip dist of stdlib.

	Add empty to test whether a table is.

	Fix paths for new directory structure and get rid of one or two gremlins.

	Finish editing std.cfg into new form (configuration file with require implementation tacked on the end) and rename it.

	Update some TODOs.

	Rename std->modules and remove stray std.lua

	Standardize code style, and make changes (mostly to the comments) to prepare for renaming to std.config, as per John's suggestion. This file will only secondarily contain require, and will typically be built into the Lua system anyway. When we move to Lua 5.0, require will disappear, anyway.

	John Belmonte's replacement require implementation (5.0-compatible).

	Reorganise directory structure to a flat directory, to cope with Lua 5.0 require patterns (so that the libraries can be loaded without making assumptions about directory separators).

2002-08-13  rrt  <rrt>

	Add the format library to text.

	Fix buglet in warn.

	Move some functions to format.lua to avoid dependency loop text<->assert and to make way for the new pretty printing functions described in a big TODO in format.lua.
	Override format in text, so that if it's only passed one argument, it
	just returns it.

	Use capability of warn to take format arguments.

2002-08-13  rrt  <rrt>

	Rename affirm to assert, and pass its arguments to the new format function.
	Remove the *f functions (which called format); these were unused. Now
	warn, die and assert can all take format arguments.

	affirm->assert in file.lua

2002-08-13  rrt  <rrt>

	Correct punctuation.

	Fix a typo loading pickle.lua in text.lua
	Make pickle escape characters in strings that need it

	Restructure stringifying so that functions in stringifier can produce either a string or a table of stringified index = stringified value pairs.
	Use this to write a simple pickle function that can pickle anything
	that tostring can stringify. pickle and tostring are now effectively
	just different renderers for the functions in stringifier.

	Fix spacing in comments.

2002-08-12  rrt  <rrt>

	Allow new tostring methods to be registered.

	*** empty log message ***

	Debug defaultTable so it uses the initial value given rather than always creating an empty table.

	Add defaultTable to macro.
	Move lookup to macro, reimplement it in terms of foldl and subscript,
	and reimplement pathSubscript in terms of it.

	Add a logic module to extend band, bor and bxor to lists (just listable them).

	Comment list.lua in ldoc format. The other modules will probably follow.

	Include the new macro module.

	Move pathSubscript out of table.lua to avoid a circular dependency, into the new macro.lua module, which also includes some material moved from global.lua.

2002-08-01  rrt  <rrt>

	Move print from assert to debug. This not only makes sense, but breaks a recursive dependency between assert and text/text.

2002-07-31  rrt  <rrt>

	Remove require for now-defunct time.lua, and tidy up the TODOs.

	Correct endofLine -> endOfLine again; this must have crept back in with the last diff. Using CVS everywhere rather than manual copying will be a Good Thing in this respect!

2002-07-30  rrt  <rrt>

	Generalised daySuffix to ordinalSuffix. Still English-specific :-(

2002-07-27  rrt  <rrt>

	Improve comment for mapIter

2002-07-26  rrt  <rrt>

	Add constant, a constant function generator.

	Use pathSubscript in methodify to allow more convenient macroization of tables.

	A simple documentation extracter, relying completely on specially formatted comments. There's no documentation at the moment except the patterns in the program, which should be obvious! I'll ldocify all the code shortly and check in instructions with it.
	This tool is provisional, and subject to improvement. The TODOs in the
	file indicate some of my first thoughts in that direction.

2002-07-24  rrt  <rrt>

	Move methodify to table.lua where it belongs (it has nothing to do with lists!)

	Allow scripts to have no arguments. If you want to display help when just the script is run with no arguments, you'll have to do it manually.

	Throw away stderr from shell commands (we don't expect the output to clutter up the screen; it's always possible to capture it by adding a redirection to the command, which will override the one we add).

	Add subscript, which exposes [] as a function.

2002-06-22  rrt  <rrt>

	Correct endofLine -> endOfLine

	Initial revision
